            <h1>Fishio</h1>
            <p>Fishio is an application designed to assess the freshness of fish based on images of the eyes and gills. Utilizing visual analysis, Fishio aims to provide accurate detection of the fish's overall quality, ensuring consumers receive fresh and high-quality seafood. In the development of Fishio, I am tasked with the UI/UX responsibilities alongside one of my teammates, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.</p>

            <h1>Re-design Tokopedia</h1>
            <p>I was enrolled in a short course on UI Design Systems at MySkill, where I have been tasked with redesigning two specific pages from Tokopedia's website. This opportunity allows me to apply the design principles I've learned in a real-world context and deepen my understanding of effective design systems.</p>
